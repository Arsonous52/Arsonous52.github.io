            A Link to the Cast is a top-down pixel art survival game where you play as a wizard wielding both sword and spell. Trapped on a single-screen battlefield, you'll fight off
            endless waves of zombies, skeletons, and wolves. The action is steady and challenging, with a focus on lasting as long as you can and racking up the highest kill count. It's
            a simple, engaging test of how far you can go before the horde overwhelms you.
